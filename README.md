Deploying a static website to AWS 

For this project I will first, create an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.

Next, I will upload the website files to my bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

Lastly, you will access the website in a browser using this unique S3 endpoint: my-409620949289-bucket.

i took screenshots of the results of each of my steps and saved them in a zipped folder.
